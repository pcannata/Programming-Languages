Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> start
Rule 1     start -> LINUX
Rule 2     start -> CPU
Rule 3     start -> ALL
Rule 4     start -> empty
Rule 5     empty -> <empty>

Terminals, with rules where they appear

ALL                  : 3
CPU                  : 2
LINUX                : 1
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

empty                : 4
start                : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . start
    (1) start -> . LINUX
    (2) start -> . CPU
    (3) start -> . ALL
    (4) start -> . empty
    (5) empty -> .

    LINUX           shift and go to state 5
    CPU             shift and go to state 3
    ALL             shift and go to state 2
    $end            reduce using rule 5 (empty -> .)

    start                          shift and go to state 1
    empty                          shift and go to state 4

state 1

    (0) S' -> start .



state 2

    (3) start -> ALL .

    $end            reduce using rule 3 (start -> ALL .)


state 3

    (2) start -> CPU .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (start -> CPU .)


state 4

    (4) start -> empty .

    $end            reduce using rule 4 (start -> empty .)


state 5

    (1) start -> LINUX .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (start -> LINUX .)
